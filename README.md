<h1>Stock Management System</h1>
<h3>Build in React with Firebase Implementation</h3>
<br/><br/>
I developed this application to aid a restaurant in managing their stock and communicating their needs with their manager.<br/>
This is a simplified version of the one requested by the restaurant broken down to the basics.<br/>
It has a login and register system with unique user stock data<br/>
Includes persistent data through <b>Firebase</b>
