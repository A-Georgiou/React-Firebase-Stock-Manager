<h1>Stock Management System</h1>
<h3>Build in React with Firebase Implementation</h3>
<br/>
<h2><a href="https://a-georgiou.github.io/Deploy-Firebase-React-Stock/">Demo This Project</a></h2>
<br/>
I developed this application to aid a restaurant in managing their stock and communicating their needs with their manager.<br/>
This is a simplified version of the one requested by the restaurant broken down to the basics.<br/>
It has a login and register system with unique user stock data<br/>
Includes persistent data through <b>Firebase</b>


# How to use the System

## Main Page
On the main page you are greeted by a simple login form.

## Registering / logging in
To Register, Enter an email and a password and press Register, should you receive a confirmation of a successful register you are now able to re-enter those details and login, otherwise you may be required to change your password if it does not meet the security requirements

## Adding / Removing Stock
Adding Stock is as simple as entering an item in the "Add item to buy:" box and pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard, this should real-time push the data to the firebase database and allow other members of staff to instantly see these changes, should you wish to increase or decrease the stock count of this item, you simply press either the /\ arrow to increase or the \/ arrow to decrease the stock respectively.<br/>
Pressing the "X" icon next to a stock item will remove that stock from your list.
